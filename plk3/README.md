### Data
We provide the sdf and pdb file for the reference ligand `PF-07976265` in the file `data/ligand.sdf` and protein structure in the file `data/protein.pdb`

### Running generation
We include the inference notebook in `generate_molecules.ipynb` to perform conditional sampling in fragment replacement.
